            <div class="overview center"><h2> <br> <br>

                Today was my first day at Northcoders! <br>
                I have already been pushed a bit. <br> <br>
                We started the day off with a brief intro to the course and introducing ourself to our fellow cohorts. 
                This was led by Chris.  One of the founders. He has background working for Sky and a few others. <br>
                
                It wasn't long before we were being led by Paul, our tutor for this block, lasting 2 weeks.  With a brief introduction to how JavaScript works - it tackles lines one by one. We covered execution context before moving onto the importance of pair programming. <br>
                We learnt the respective roles of each person in the pair - the driver and the navigator. 
                The driver mainly writes the code. The navigator proposing the solutions and thought processes. <br>
                
                From there we covered test driven development. This is where we write tests for our code to pass. Mainly upon each important iteration. <br>
                
                After an hour break at 1 we came back to be let loose on our own coding challenges and to write our own tests for the challenges.<br>  
                
                In all honesty it was hard! It was a new way of coding which none of us had previous experience with. Sometimes it felt like we were trying to catch ourselves out. <br>
                My partner, Nichola, and I made our way through a few of them before departing at 6. <br> <br>
                
                What a fantastic start to our first day :D <br> <br>
                
                To summarise:
                Although I was originally naturally a bit apprehensive about what we would study and how ready I was, I feel I have already found a good few friends and a great opportunity . <br> <br>

                P.S Thank God it's light in the mornings. At least getting up will be a bit easier.      <h2></div>
