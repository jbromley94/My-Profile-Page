          <br> Absolutely fantastic result with our Pokemen Battler. Good lawsuit avoidance there right?
          <br> So, why is it so great you ask. Well let's get this list started:
          <br> 1) We've got the Rocky music as our theme. (lawsuit here we come again)
          <br> 2) The music is very well timed, usually the player gets into the battle section of the music as they start the
          battle!
          <br> 3) Critical effect and type effect are both included.
          <br> 4) A fulll set of four moves, all alter the damage of the attacker too.
          <br> 5) One of the moves, doesn't inflict damage but ups the players health, anothere takes hp from the opponent and
          returns some health to the player! Even a self-destruct!
          <br> 6) One of our Pokemen actually evolves through the battle(depending on a random number), which changes health,
          damage. Well the whole Pokemen object really!
          <br>

          <br>So I ended up having to resit CORE. Hence my abscence for the past few days.
          <br> I found it to be a really good opportunity though, to be able to get fully to grips with the previous material.
          <br>
          <br> I think this has really helped to excel, the quality of my finished katas is very very clear. Shorter code, using
          more Array methods too. Which i was a tad unsure about using.
          <br> It's now the penultimate day before the weekend. Already Chris and myself are on point with the Pokemon Battler!
          Even managed to add music to it on the first day of the sprint. So we're both feeling great for the last day of
          Core.
          <br> There will be an update to that tomorrow. So I shall see whether I can upload as a public to github and if i can
          you might be able to have a look.
