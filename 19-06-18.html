          <br> REALLY REALLY LOVING THIS MODULE!
          <br>
          <br> So, we have been making our own server over the past couple of days, that deals with a client inutting requests and us filtering through our database to be able to return  both a result and some more info, such as the status.
          <br>
          It's been really fun, we managed to get quite far yesterday between Stuart, Tim and myself. We completed all of the first two tasks.
          <br> Today we refactored our code so that it is very split up, according to files and what is pointing to what. So our files and folders basically consisted of :
          <br> ~ A file for running the listening side of the server.
          <br> ~ A file for our api to direct towards our router.
          <br> ~ A folder for our router methods, to target each controller.
          <br> ~ A folder for our controller to point to the models.
          <br> ~ A folder for our models, that contains most of the logic.
          <br> ~ A folder full of info to either send back, or edit. 
          <br>
          <br> It's been really fun and it just feels so awesome to be gearing towards future employment, and understanding why this is neccessary and important! 
          <br> 
          <br>
          Really loving this module!
