                Wow! I thought yesterday was tough. I guess I should have realised when it said on the testimonials. <br> <br>

So we got in and started at 8.30.
We spent an hour and half just on our own private katas today. Before a lecture held by Paul. <br>
He is really good and engaging, and I think his constant beaming smile settles all our nerves when we - already- are having problems we have to work hard to tackle. <br>
The lecture didn't seem as long as yesterday's and we were soon upstairs to tackle 1)the pair katas we were last working on yesterday and 2) a new set of pairing katas. These new katas were very tough. Challenging and sometimes gruelling but still fun as Nic and I felt a great sense achievement when we got it right. <br>
I also think we got a better hold on working with our tests first before starting our code. And it really did help!<br> <br>

After our break at 1 we got back in and got back to work. Tackling what we didn't finish. Not to say that we did finish everything.
