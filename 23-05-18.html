                What a fantastic end to the start of the weekend, and end to our first week! <br><br>
                We spent today continuing with our lodash katas. Where we work with each to get a greater understanding of how certain methods work 
                by actually designing them ourselves!<br>
                This is all great and exciting, whilst still challenging, with the reward of success when one beats the challenge!<br>
                Both my partner and I feel it is a great insight into looking at things under the hood. <br>
                We had a short presentation too by some cohorts who are further along with the process.<br><br>
                It was exciting to see what they had made. It was all front end website design. I think it really motivated a lot of us and got us 
                really anticipating what's to come. For us to be at that stage in only a couple of weeks is going to be amazing!!!! As you may be able to tell
                I do like the front-end aspect. Possibly because I can directly see my code in action live on screen.<br><br>
                A really pleasant surprise was getting handed a beer around 5 to welcome the weekend in, before we finished at 6. As well as this an invitation to 
                go down to the local bar after was a really nice touch. It helped me feel included and valued really early on!<br><br>
                All glasses were raised in acknowledgement of the great decision we all made to be a Northcoder!!!
