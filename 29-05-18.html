                So, for anyone who has been with me from the start<br>
                1) I might have mentioned it was a bank holiday just gone.<br>
                2) It was review day! DUN DUN DUUUHH!<br>
                So, I've carried out the challenges that were given to us at around 9 this morning, and I'm currently waiting to see whether 
                I shall be progressing onto Back-End 1(BE1) over the next couple of weeks. The time currently stands at 15:53<br>
                Chris has just been summoned and I shall have an idea about how long the process takes once he is back<br><br>
                On a lighter note, we had a presentation by some hiring partners today; Barclays and BuildEmpire. <br>
                They were both different sorts of companies, each with interesting caveats, and a nice approach to work. <br><br>
                We have been tasked with some CSS challenges so that we don't forget it all come FE1. So i shall bid you adieu and get on with that.

                 <br> <br>
