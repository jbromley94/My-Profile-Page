        <h2>
          <br>
          <br> Its starting to make much sense to me now.
          <br>I think I must be just be more wired toward ubnderstanding things better when appling them through an 'effective'
          task as opposed to an arbitary task. Like getting cats legs from an object.
          <br>Now it's not really all that different really, I'm still looking at objects, and extracting or manipulating data.
          But for me it just makes it seem mre logical and sensical. I guess its just the way my mind works.
          <br>
          <br>Which makes me really happy that I'm not just learning about code and programming, but about myself, and the ways
          I learn and like to study.
          <br>
          <br> So it's coming up to 6 now on this friday eve and it will soon be time to shoot down to the Pilcrow - I think
          that's the name - for a well deserved beer at the end of the week and some good conversation with my fellow cohorts
          and friends.
