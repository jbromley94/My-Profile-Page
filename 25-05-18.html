                Well that's Core done and dusted. Hopefully - you'll see why in the coming paragraphs. <br><br>
So, we finished the week off by actually making our first program! A small pokemon style app ran through the console. In fairness my partner, Chris and I didn't manage to fully complete it. But that's only due to Paul coming about as we were setting constants in our test and told us that was right. We forgot to use our own heads though and thus wrote all our code in that file. It was fun though! Plus I really like working with Chris and feel we bounce off each other. <br>
We had this task or sprint span over 2 days. It was fun just to get to grips with actual creation.  <br><br>
I really couldn't stress enough though that a map should be used when one starts something from scratch <br><br>
TDD is great and keeps you focused. But if you don't plan your tests before hand yu can soon sink into a stage pit of going nowhere. But hey, we're here to learn right!? <br><br>
So in regards to my mention at the start. We have our first block review this Tuesday(bank holiday n that). How am I feeling you ask? Well....I guess I'm obviously slightly apprehensive, however it's not a 'test' per se. More of an insight whether we have the adequate grounding Northcoders believe to know whether we're ready for the next level. It could even be argued it's a sort of opportunity to go over material if one's grounding is not concrete.  <br>
That really is a GREAT benefit I see of this course. To resit a 2 week module at no extra cost IS A great opportunity. After all, it's not just ourselves who want to be or do our best.  Northcoders wants to make sure it only sends the best to the workforce - not in a Trump way though. <br><br>
PAHHHH!! Enough of politics though. Let's not cloud this blog with that.<br><br>
So I'm rather bust this weekend. Tenant issues and walks in the supposed great weather. So some revision shall be done. With the ephasis on dome in that sentence. <br>
- So wish me luck friend, and hopefully you shall have news that I am now on Back-end 1. Yet alas if that is not the case, be happy that I get another chance to flourish and cement my knowledge.
