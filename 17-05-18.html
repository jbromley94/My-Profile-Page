            <div class="overview center"><h2> <br> <br>
                Everything is moving so quickly!<br>
                I already feel that the lack of entry yesterday is a big gap in this series, and it will be a series!<br> <br>
                So a quick overview about that, it was roughly the same structure as the 15th.<br>
                A set of private katas in the morning followed by a lecture and some pair programming.<br>
                We swapped our pairs over and worked on a new set of katas. Mainly focus with using .map and .filter<br>
                That fed in very well into what would occur today<br>
                So, onwards and upwards to today's experience<br> <br>
                As seems the norm already, a sett of private kats until our first lecture at 10.<br>
                Paul lead us through scope and hoisting, and its importance with the use of functions, as well as accessing variables, or not accessing variable<br>
                After our lecture was over, I had a quick word with Paul about tying JS into HTML. <br>
                I feel I'm reasonably capable with each, enough so to produce a calculator, so hopefully that should be an accomplishment I make this weekend! Stay on the lookout as it should reach my Github account by monday!<br> <br>
                We swapped pairs again, so after working with Chris yesterday, Vel and I teamed up today.<br>
                If I admitted to every other day being hard, well, you might as well just dismiss what I said.<br>
                We were using our knowledge to recreate lodash functions. <br>
                The first few were alright and then we hit _.map. WOW!!!!<br><br>
                We broke for lunch at 1 as per, and came back to a lecture at 2<br>
                Paul led us through a new method of testing using .spy<br>
                So just as we were getting to grips with our new tools, we were thrown another toy to play with<br>
                Everything just moves at the speed of light here (or should I say warp speed)!<br>
                Vel and I managed to work it out however and almost finished our forEach. <br><br>
                To say I cannot wait for my head to hit that pillow tonight would be an understatement!<br>
                Until tomorrow. <br>
                Over and out
                 <br> <br>
                Jordan
